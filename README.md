ðŸ“˜ Fast Lang Compiler (Flex & Bison)
A complete compiler for a custom language named Fast Lang, developed using Flex and Bison as part of a Compiler Construction course project.

ðŸ”§ Features
Lexical Analysis â€“ Tokenizes the source code using Flex.

Syntax Analysis â€“ Validates grammar using Bison based on C-like rules.

Semantic Analysis â€“ Checks types, scoping, and function rules.

Intermediate Code Generation â€“ Outputs three-address code for valid input programs.

Error Handling â€“ Reports meaningful error messages with line numbers.

ðŸš€ Usage
The compiler reads a source file written in Fast Lang, checks for errors, and generates intermediate code if the program is valid.
